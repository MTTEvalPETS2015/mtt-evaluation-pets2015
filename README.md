## TBD

### running procedure in general


#### make it work on sir74c
1. enter the 'lsvm4' directory and run make.m
2. compile the implementation of the Hungarian algorithm
> running make.m in the tracking directory
3. run the object detector
Ahhhhh!!!! sir74c hard drive failed, again...third times!!!!

#### make it work on MacBook Pro (please, dont kill my mac!)
ok, Im kinda scared of running this thing, considering the damage it has caused to a powerful desktop...
it may have nothing to do with it in the first place of course...
